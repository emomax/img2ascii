# img2ascii

An example of how to use the canvas tag to generate ASCII-art! Contributions are welcome. 

# List of improvements: 
	* Make a file-drop feature to automagically convert dropped img to ASCII.
	* Make a copy-to-clipboard button for ease of copy-pasting.
	* Create a GUI to change amount of pixels, scaling algorithm etc.
	* Create an awesome logo for this simple tool.
